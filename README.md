# Hurricane-force extratropical low archive

The archive of hurricane-force (64 kt or more) extratropical lows in the North
Atlantic and North Pacific, the site that presents it, and the research built
on it: recovery of each storm's life before it reached hurricane force, and an
ERA5-based proxy record reaching back to 1979.

This repository was split out of `jkrek17/awips-tools` in October 2026 with the
history of its files intact. Pull request numbers in older commit messages are
written `jkrek17/awips-tools#NN` and refer to that repository.

**Start with `STATUS.md`.** It lists the branches in flight, what exists and
what does not, and the gates on how results may be used. `CLAUDE.md` holds the
standing rules for work sessions.

## Contents

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `data/hf_lows/` | CSV exports of the archive workbook, committed on purpose (see below), plus derived tables from the precursor recovery. |
| `tools/build_hf_lows.py` | Normalizes those CSVs into the site data under `docs/data/`. |
| `tools/publish.py` | Production path: fetches, builds, reports the delta, and (on request) deploys to the NOAA web root. |
| `tools/build_coastlines.py`, `build_currents.py`, `build_teleconnections.py` | Build the globe outlines, the surface-current underlay, and the climate index series baked into the site data. |
| `docs/` | The archive site. GitHub Pages serves it as a development preview; production is a separate copy on a NOAA web server. |
| `flat/` | Generated. The same site collapsed into one directory for upload UIs that cannot take folders. Never edit by hand. |
| `web/HFArchiveExport/` | Google Apps Script web app that exports the restricted sheet as CSV for `tools/publish.py`. |
| `tests/` | Node and Python checks for the site code and the build. |
| `tools/fetch_hsf.py`, `parse_hsf.py`, `track_hsf.py`, `review_collisions.py` | Precursor recovery from High Seas Forecast text. On the research branches until merged; see `STATUS.md`. |
| `research/era5/` | ERA5 proxy record. On the research branches until merged; see `STATUS.md`. |

## HF extratropical low archive site

A static page for browsing and summarizing hurricane force extratropical lows in
the North Atlantic and North Pacific - tracks, climatology charts, a searchable
event table, and a data quality report. See `docs/README.md`.

There are **two environments**, deliberately kept apart. Both build the same
`docs/` from the same code; they differ only in where the data comes from and
where the result is served. See "Which environment am I looking at?" below
for how to tell them apart on the page itself.

### Development: this repo + GitHub Pages

This repo is public, and the two decades of hand-entered archive CSVs under
`data/hf_lows/` are committed to it - that's intentional, confirmed by the
archive's owner, not an oversight. Edit, commit and push here; a GitHub
Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) rebuilds `docs/` from those
committed CSVs and publishes it to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. That
workflow also runs `html-validate` over `docs/` before publishing - the same
check (and defaults) the forecaster's downstream `ocean-weather-gov` CI runs
- so an invalid page fails here instead of blocking their merge request.

```bash
# 1. export each basin tab of the workbook over the CSVs in data/hf_lows/
# 2. rebuild the site data
python3 tools/build_hf_lows.py
# 3. commit both the CSVs and docs/data, then push - Actions does the rest
```

Preview locally with `python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory docs`.

Stage files by name rather than with `git add -A`: several regenerable
intermediates (the 67 MB parsed High Seas lows, the ERA5 caches) sit next to
committed data. `.githooks/pre-commit` refuses staged files over 10 MB and pip
wheels or archives; enable it once per clone with
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (Claude Code sessions do this on start
via `.claude/settings.json`).

This published Pages site is a **preview of the code and of whatever data
happens to be committed** - it is not the operational page, and it can lag or
lead the real archive depending on when someone last exported and committed.

### Production: `tools/publish.py` + the NOAA web server

The operational page lives on a NOAA web server the forecaster controls, and
the code reaches it by hand - copied out of this GitHub repo, not deployed
from it. **GitHub is not in the production path at all**: nothing there
pulls from GitHub, calls its API, or depends on Pages, Actions, or the
service being reachable. A GitHub outage, a policy change, or the repo going
private or disappearing cannot take the operational page down.

Data reaches production through `tools/publish.py`, which wraps the whole
workflow - fetch, build, review, deploy - into one deliberate command. It
never runs `git` and never needs a Google account, OAuth token or service
account: the sheet stays restricted to "anyone in NOAA", and it fetches
through a companion Apps Script web app (`web/HFArchiveExport/`, run by
someone who already has the sheet open) rather than reading the sheet
directly. Every publish is a decision a human makes after reading a
plain-English delta report - see "Publishing" below.

### Which environment am I looking at?

The page cannot know for certain which copy it is, but it makes a good-faith
guess and says so:

- A small **"Preview build"** or **"Local build"** marker appears next to the
  "Experimental" badge in the masthead when the page is served from a
  `*.github.io` host or from `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`. No marker at all means
  the page believes it's production (any other hostname) - it is never shown
  on the real NOAA server.
- The **Method** tab's footnote (below "Rebuilding") always states when the
  page was built, from which git commit (or "commit unknown" - expected on
  the production server, which is a plain code copy with no `.git`
  directory), and whether the data was fetched via Apps Script or built from
  CSVs already on disk.

If two people are looking at different numbers, check these two things
before anything else.

## Publishing

### One-time setup - pick one of two input modes

- **Fetch from the sheet automatically.** The sheet can't be link-shared, so
  the anonymous CSV export URL won't work; instead have the sheet owner deploy
  a small Apps Script web app that exports each tab as CSV over HTTPS
  (`?token=...&tab=atl|pac`), deployed "Execute as: Me" / "Who has access:
  Anyone" so the sheet itself never has to leave "anyone in NOAA". Then set:

  ```bash
  export HF_EXPORT_URL="https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycb.../exec"
  export HF_EXPORT_TOKEN="<the shared secret the Apps Script checks>"
  ```

  or put the same two values in `tools/publish.local.json` (already
  gitignored - the token is a secret and must never land in a commit):

  ```json
  {"url": "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycb.../exec",
   "token": "<the shared secret the Apps Script checks>"}
  ```

- **Export by hand.** Download each basin tab as CSV (File > Download > Comma
  Separated Values) into `data/hf_lows/` yourself, and always run with
  `--no-fetch`. No setup needed, and it works today even before the Apps
  Script exists.

Both modes feed the same build, review and deploy steps below.

### Normal workflow

```bash
python3 tools/publish.py                        # fetch, build, print what changed
python3 tools/publish.py --no-fetch              # same, but build from CSVs already on disk
python3 tools/publish.py --deploy /var/www/hf    # also publish, after you type y to confirm
python3 tools/publish.py --deploy /var/www/hf --yes   # publish with no prompt, e.g. from cron
```

Run it without `--deploy` first and read the report before deciding anything:
events added, removed or modified (with dates and basins for the additions),
any season whose event count moved, data-quality notes that appeared or
disappeared, and the total event/fix counts before and after. "No changes"
means the sheet hasn't moved since the last publish - that's the common case
and it says so in one line.

Only pass `--deploy PATH` once that report looks right. It copies `docs/`
into an existing web root as one atomic directory swap, so the live site is
never caught half-updated mid-copy, prints exactly what it wrote, and leaves
anything already in that directory that the site doesn't own untouched.
Without `--yes` it shows the delta report and waits for you to type `y`.

### Flat deploys (`--flat`)

Some web servers are only reachable through an upload UI that takes
individual files, not a directory tree - it cannot recreate `docs/`'s
`assets/` and `data/` subdirectories. `--flat` handles that: it writes every
file directly into the target with no subdirectories, and rewrites the
deployed copy of `index.html` so its `src=`/`href=` references point at the
bare filenames instead. `docs/index.html` itself is never modified - only the
copy written to the target.

```bash
python3 tools/publish.py --no-fetch --deploy /var/www/flat --flat --yes
```

Before writing anything, `--flat` re-checks the assumption that makes
flattening safe - no two files share a basename, and no CSS/JS outside
`index.html` hardcodes an `assets/...` or `data/...` path - and refuses to
deploy, naming exactly what it found, if either check fails.

A copy of that flattened build is committed to this repo as `flat/`, so the
files can be browsed and downloaded one at a time from GitHub without running
the tool. It is generated output: edit `docs/`, never `flat/`. Regenerate it
with

```bash
python3 tools/publish.py --no-fetch --deploy flat --flat --yes
rm -f flat/.awips-publish-manifest.json
cp docs/data/hf-lows.js docs/data/hf-lows.json docs/data/qc-report.txt flat/
```

The last line matters: a rebuild stamps a fresh `generated` timestamp into the
three generated data files, so copying `docs/`'s versions across keeps the two
trees byte-identical and the CI drift check quiet. That check compares `flat/`
against `docs/` on every push and fails if they diverge, since a stale `flat/`
would quietly hand someone the wrong files to upload.

Don't point a flat deploy and a normal deploy at the same directory. Each
mode leaves the other layout's files in place unless this tool's own manifest
in that directory already tracks them (i.e. this tool made the previous
deploy there in the *other* mode); mixing them can leave stale files sitting
next to the current site, and `--flat`/normal will warn if it finds files
that look like the other layout in the target. Use a dedicated directory
per layout.

### Moving to cron

Once you trust the report, drop the confirmation and let it run unattended:

```cron
0 6 * * * cd /path/to/this/repo && python3 tools/publish.py --deploy /var/www/hf --yes >> /var/log/hf-publish.log 2>&1
```

It exits non-zero on any failure (a bad fetch, a bad deploy target) and 0
otherwise, whether or not anything changed - point cron's mail, or whatever
alerts on a non-zero exit, at it, and watch the log for a while before fully
trusting an unattended run.
